The main steps will go as follows: - Start your Design System - Design Application - Configure Storybook - Add Components - Publish your Design System Although the resulting Design System will obviously not be finished by finishing these steps, you’ll have everything set up to start on the real work. One more reason why we think: relying on kickstartDS when building your Design System is of huge value for you and the Open Source community, who can start building more adapters and implementations on top of kickstartDS to simplify the process of applying Design Systems.\n"

Have a look at the screenshot below, to get a feel for how this looks: Token application With all those macro design decisions out of the way, I could now move on with customizing the individual token values, which got generated for me from the theming input I defined before. At that point the pages were starting to look almost identical… I had to re-check the URL to make sure what page I was on 😉 Customization If you want to step outside the foundational layer of design tokens automatically available to you, and get really creative with your styling, you can always just as easily customize the components more directly.\n"

We prefer using nvm, a pretty widely used, terminal based solution: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm We also include a .nvmrc file with all our repositories, specifying the currently used and supported version, for example this one for the main repository of kickstartDS: https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/blob/next/.nvmrc With nvm installed, just switch to the folder and call: Which should net you something like this: If the needed version is not found locally, you're automatically prompted with the correct command to install it. You can find our repository here: github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS Popular configuration guides include: GitHub: Set up Git Gitlab: Installing Git Bitbucket: Install Git Git GUI If working with the terminal is not your thing, you might want to use a dedicated Git GUI (Graphical User Interface).\n",
