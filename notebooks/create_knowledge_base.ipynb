The design system serves as the single point of truth and empowers digital teams to create seamless, brand-consistent and unified experiences. Here is NN/g: Nielsen Norman Group’s description: Design Systems – also known as “pattern libraries” or “component libraries” – promote quality, consistent UX design across products; and expedite the work of designers, developers, and anyone else working on a digital service. It’s important to realize that every design system should be the result of different stakeholders within an organization, often sharing the same objectives, but each with their very own perspective. The main user group is normally a multi-disciplinary team of designers, front-end developers and UX. They are the ones primarily caring for, maintaining and sharing the design system. But without the collaboration and contribution of mostly all parties involved in digital product and service creation, such a system will fail tremendously fast. We believe that every organization even running only a few digital experiences will already benefit from a design system. So, when should you …\n",

      "\t4.090\tFeatures\tThis starter is already quite rich in features that are enabled out-of-the-box for you.. To give you some orientation, while also describing the intention behind features, and ensuring you can actually make the most out of your Design System.. Design Token integration One important part of a Design System is having a well structured and semantic token system in place.. Learn about customizing your Design Token set in our dedicated section above, helping you to adapt your own branding / CI / CD.. Design Token can be initialized by changing the values in src/token/branding-token.json and calling yarn init-tokens, and compiled to CSS Custom Properties by running yarn build-tokens.. While yarn init-tokens generates your Design Token set in src/token/dictionary, yarn build-tokens reads it from there, and outputs the resulting formats (which CSS Custom Properties is just one of) according to your Style Dictionary config.. We already include a minimal Style Dictionary configuration as part of our CLI, but you can overwrite this configuration by adding a sd.config.cjs to your repository root.. Explore that file for details on the formats configured in this starter (the path the format output is written to can be influenced by setting buildPath): |Platform||Description| css |Creates a |Design Token converted to CSS Custom Properties, using the naming structure expected by Component Token in html HTML icon sprite (learn more), that is needed when integrating raw HTML (e.g.. into PHP, ASP.NET, or similar).. Also serves as the central icon file read by the storybook-design-token addon.. Added as jsx React version of the same file as the one above, this should be used when working with React directly.. Called storybook |Writes a selection of files (|storybook-design-token addon js |This also creates a file (|Storybook, to add some light theming to your instance based on your Design Token set.. Also included is a set of Storybook pages documenting your Design Token set, using aforementioned storybook-design-token addon.. You can find them in docs/tokens, feel free to adjust them to your liking!. You can also have a look at our Figma token file visualizing exactly that token structure: To learn more about Design Token and their support in kickstartDS read our first release spotlight: Release Spotlight: Semantic Token.. Storybook integration Some aspects of our integration with Storybook were already covered by the last section about Design Token integration..\n",
      "\t4.018\tConnect to Design Tooling\t... to help bridge the dev-design divide How Design Tokens enable better processes: Tokens are the perfect starting ground when establishing shared processes and responsibilities between designers and developers, as they encode the most atomic design decisions of your Design System. Connecting design tools like Figma through Style Dictionary, or using complementary services to manage your Design System like Backlight, helps set up a baseline for your team, without requiring you to do everything by yourself! Style Dictionary Style Dictionary is a tool developed by Amazon to help with establishing a dependable structure for your Design Tokens. This includes defining them in a well-defined way (JSON) and then converting them to different target formats: CSS Properties, iOS definitions or themes. All our tokens are defined in a Style Dictionary. Figma Figma is currently taking the design space by storm. We offer a Figma template with all our semantic Design Tokens encoded in a visual way. You can even change values in Figma, and use one of our connectors to integrate them back into your code base automatically... for example as part of your CI/CD Backlight Backlight can function as your teams whole-in-one platform for Design System management / DesignOps. kickstartDS is wholly compatible with Backlight, and its features like the Style Dictionary integration, bundling and packaging, etc. You can even use our starter to cut even more corners in getting your first Design System release live!.\n",
      "\t3.308\tBranding, Design & Component Token\tToken are the smallest building blocks of a Design System. Based on the values they store, they are usually used across multiple tools and platforms to ensure consistency and matching brand identity. kickstartDS differentiates between Branding, Design and Component Token. Whereas Design Token store values e.g. color, typography, spacing, animation, etc., Branding Token come in handy offering a structured approach towards applying your company’s brand identity or corporate design at one single spot with maximum efficiency. Component Token represent the properties and values that are contained in a component, e.g. controlling how its container, label text, icons, and states look. Since we are publicly open source now, the great thing is, that you can check out that structure on your own in our repo.\n",
